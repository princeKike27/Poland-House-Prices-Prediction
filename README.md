# Poland-House-Prices-Prediction

For this project I analyzed data from the housing market in 3 cities in Poland Krakow, Warsaw and Pozna≈Ñ. Using a dataset from *Kaggle* I created a Multiple Linear Regression Model that predicts a houses' price based on features like its city, the number of rooms, the number of floors, its area and the year it was built.

Throught the project you will be able to find:

- Data cleaning and standardization.
- Analysis of Relevant features to build the model.
- Multiple Linear Regression Model to predict a houses' price.
- Cost Function C
- Gradient of C with respect to model parameters.
- Gradient Descent of model.
- Function to Predict a House Price.
- Creation of Web App to visualize model - Poland House Price Calculator.
